<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Amelia, and this is my mostly ham radio-related website, with all of my other projects or anything else I want to post online included. I've been licensed for about 4 years, and I'm active on HF, VHF, and UHF.
    Currently I'm at college for my first year, and I haven't brought any radios. Next semester, I plan to bring CW radios for 20M and 40M, and I'll throw in a Baofeng as well.
    Perhaps I'll even try to bring my IC-7000.</p>
<p>I'm studying Aviation with a Professional Pilot focus - AKA I'm training to be a pilot. Once I graduate and finish all of my ratings, I hope to become a corporate pilot, and fly private jets.</p>
